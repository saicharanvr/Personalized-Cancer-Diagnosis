If the patient seems to have tumour, the pathologist will take this tumour and do some gene sequencing to know the genetic mutation(a small change in gene). Here with the help of two features I.e, gene and variation we will classify into 9 classes and some of this classes will say whether the person has cancer or not. In general all these analysis  is  done manually, but its time consuming .Here we automate this processs with different machine learning algorithms
